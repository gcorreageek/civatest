# Flit Interviews #

Welcome to Flit's recruitment process! We're very excited to have you as a potential candidate. This is a repository you will use during your practical interview.

## Interview Process ##

The process will vary depending on the role that you are interviewing for. In general, you will have a couple questions to answer using code and possibly a simple feature to implement. Your interviewer(s) will guide you through this process, point you to the right files and give you any pointers that might come in handy.

## Use Your Own Branch ##

In order to avoid any coincidental merge conflicts, we ask that before you start coding, you create a branch within this repository. You can do this with git by running:

```
git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
```

Replace `<name-of-branch>` with your name, so that the command ends up looking like this: `git checkout -b juan-carlos-farah`.
